# Introduction #

This project is forked from https://github.com/ClaudiaSanchez/LikingProductLandscape and it is slightly modified in order to obtain, mostly, all the conditions from the script Dr. Sánchez produced.

# Description #

We complement the example from the project of Dr. Sánchez, which is very good but that it does not uses all of its functions.

In this project we are adding Hierarchical Clustering Dendogram, consumers classifications grouped by colour, clustering groups with Mean ± S.D. and spatial distribution around the map landscape

# Statement #

This modified script, which is a subtopic of our manuscript, is now being revised along with the manuscript in a peer-review international journal. In order to understand how the script works, we added detailed instructions in the folder “Tutorial as to how to produce the results” inside the Experiments main folder.
