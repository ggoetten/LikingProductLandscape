# Introduction #

This project is forked from https://github.com/ClaudiaSanchez/LikingProductLandscape and it is slightly modified in order to obtain, mostly, all the conditions from the script Dr. Sánchez produced.

# Description #

Even though the example from the project of Dr. Sánchez is very good, it does not uses all its functions.

In this project we are adding Hierarchical Clustering Dendogram, consumers classifications grouped by colour, clustering groups with Mean ± S.D. and spatial distribution around the map landscape

# Brief statement #

This is a work in progress which we will hopefully add examples compared to our manuscript in order to be easier to understand the script
